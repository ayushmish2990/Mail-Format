Dear Sir,

Sub.: Reminder for paying dues.

This is to remind you that your organization has taken a loan of Rs. 2 crores two years back on June 18. As per the agreement and loan guidelines, on completion of one and a half year, you would need to pay back the 80% of the principal amount with the appropriate interest.

Since now we have received just 50% of the principal amount. As the payment is due since long, we would appreciate if you send the cheque immediately.

I request you to kindly look into the matter within the next six working days. Otherwise, strict legal action will be taken. Kindly acknowledge the matter.

Thanking You.

Yours Sincerely
FMG
